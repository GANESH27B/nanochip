- Role-Based Stakeholder Dashboards: Provide customized user interfaces for different stakeholders (FDA, manufacturers, distributors, pharmacies) to access relevant information and tools.
- FDA Approval Workflow: Request and approve drug batches via a secure ledger simulation, streamlining the regulatory process.
- Alerts and Tamper Detection: Automatically detect and alert stakeholders to anomalies such as temperature deviations, tampering attempts, and fake transfers using IoT data and ledger monitoring. Includes a 'tool' using an LLM to analyze alerts and summarize actions that stakeholders need to take.
